      Health and safety legislation states that construction equipment users
      should formulate a site

      specific Safe System of Work to undertake any work they are planning. This guide was designed

      to offer basic instruction of Shoring Equipment Systems including the assembly, installation and

      extraction of the Manhole Box, including the Manhole and Backhoe Manhole Boxes. The correct

      sizes and weights of the components will also be shown so that use of equipment can be planned

      ahead. It is necessary that users enforce the appropriate safety practices of excavations and

      trenching throughout installation.


      The users of Shoring Equipment should be familiar, confident and competent when handling

      and installing boxes and accessories. Altrad Generation Hire & Sale excavation systems can be

      supplied with a full range of additional safety products including ladder access and guardrails as

      well as various other ancillary products. These products are designed to act in accordance with

      the practice of Shoring Equipment and meet the requirements of the Lifting Operations & Lifting

      Equipment Regulations, Work at Height Regulations and the Confined Spaces Regulations.


      Personnel should make themselves aware that certain conditions such as the close proximity

      of structures, site roads, railways and excavated materials near the trench can all increase

      surrounding earth pressures. If in doubt please seek advice.


      **For additional details please contact your local Altrad Generation Hire and Sale Branch.**

        paragraph: Push each corner in turn until the box reaches the limit. Install
          edge protection and ladder access. Enter excavation once safety is
          declared.
  - heading: Adding a top box
    body: |-
      1. Fit the panel connectors to the top box
      2. Lift the box so these panel connectors hang down
      3. Locate the panel connectors in the top of the panel
      4. Then pin through connectors and panel
      5. Secure with these with ‘R’ Clips
      6. Repeat stage 4 and 5 until required depth
  - heading: Extraction
    body: >-
      Extraction is the reverse of installation. Ensure that the trench is
      backfilled before lifting each corner in turn until box is at least 300mm
      above ground level, then attach 4 Leg Chain and lift box from the
      excavation.


      **A.** Attach a Snatch Chain to one lifting point and pull vertically. Repeat this for each corner. **B.** The next stage is to connect all four legs of the lifting chain and lift vertically.

  - heading: Safety Tips
    body: >-
      * Please refrain from using the box on unstable ground and within close
      proximity to structures due to increase in Earth Pressure.

      * Plan all excavations ahead of time to ensure that the correct lifting operations can be used.

      * Ensure that all personnel required to install this equipment are suitably trained and supervised whilst assembly and installation is in progress.

      * Inspect all components, including lifting points, struts, clips and pins.

      * Boxes should never be left ﬂying above the base of the excavation.

      * Leave 100mm of the box above ground level on the base/top box.

      * Refrain from bearing weight with the bucket in the middle of the panel during installation.

      * Only access the box via ladder access.

      * Never move the box whilst personnel are inside the excavation.

      * Do not use any un-supported part of the trench as access.

      * Top Boxes and extension panels are not to be removed before the top of the base box is above ground level.

      * To minimise damage do not lift the box via the struts or laterally load them.

      * Attach Ladder Access and Guardrails before use.

      * Seek advice if you are in doubt.
